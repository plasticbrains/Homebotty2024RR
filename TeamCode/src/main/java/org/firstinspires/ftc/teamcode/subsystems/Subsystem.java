*   Base subsystem class representing a subsystem of the robot.

*
*   The subsystem should have instance variables for motors, servos, sensors, etc.
*
*   A subsystem can run RoadRunner actions, but only one at a time.
*   Code that keeps track of and runs Actions lives in the opmode, since
*   it will differ between autonomous and teleops.
*
*   Generally, controls should be programmed in the opmode, while the
*   motors should be controlled here using a method.
